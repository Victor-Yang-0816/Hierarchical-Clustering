A coursework for the Data Mining module COMP6237 at university. We were given a data set and we had to perform data mining techniques on the data. The data set used for this assignment is a set of 24 texts about Antiquity (both classical and secondary literature). The books were scanned and run through an Optical Character Recognition system to produce HTML documents.

The data has been parsed into a usable format, after which we have perfomed feature extraction to remove stopwords and to tokenize our data. A TF-IDF matrix has been constructed an an analysis on the data has been done afterwards. We have analysed our data using Multidimensional Scaling (MSD) to create our visualisation of our K-means clustering. We have also done a Hierarchical Clustering to illustrate the relation between the books and how close they are to each other in terms of content.

For data-visualisation techniques, TSNE has been performed as well, but in this particular case, the MDS has produced better results.
